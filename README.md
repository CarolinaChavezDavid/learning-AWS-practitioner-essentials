* **Client**: Can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers.
* **Server**: Can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.
* **Cloud Computing**:is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

#### Cloud deployment models:
* **Cloud-Based deployment**: Run all parts of the application in the cloud, migrate existing applications to the cloud, design and build new applications in the cloud.
* **On-Premises deployment** (private cloud deployment): Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools, Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.
* **Hybrid deployment**: Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure, integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

 ***<div align="center">üìô Host traditional applications, full access to the OS</div>***
The AWS service provides access to virtual servers. It's highly flexible, cost-effective, and quick (secure, compute rezible capacity). AWS builds and secure the datacenters, puchase and install sesrvers, and the servers are online and ready to use.
With EC2 instances you are responsable for patching your instances when new software packages come out, setting up the scaling of those instances as well as ensuring that you've architected your solutions to be hosted in a highly available manner. 
* Multitenancy: sharing underlying hardware between virtual machines. is manage by AWS


### Amazon EC2 configuration:

**<div align="center">(üöÄ Launch  üñ•Ô∏è  Conect  üìß Use )</div>**

üöÄ Operating system: you can choose eaither Windows or Linux </br>
üöÄ Aplication(s) server: Software running on the instance Internal buisiness apps, web apps, Data bases, thir-part applications...</br>
üöÄ Instance type</br>
* Vertical Scaling: EC2 instances are also resizable. You might start with a small instance, realize the application you are running is starting to max out that server, and then you can give that instance more memory and more CPU.</br>
üöÄControl over the Networking: Type of requests</br>

### Amazon EC2 types:
Each Amazon EC2 instance type is grouped under an instance family and optimized for certain types of tasks. Instance types offer varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity, and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications.
* **General purpose instances:** Provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources (Application, gaming and backend services and small and medium databases)
* **Compute optimized instances:** Ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors for instances processing workloads that require processing many transactions in a single group.
* **Memory optimized instances:** are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory for instance workload that requires large amounts of data to be preloaded before running aplications (Ideal for high-performance databases)
* **Accelerated computing instances:** use hardware accelerator or coprocessors, to perform some functions more efficiently than possible in software running on CPUs for instance floating-point number calculations, graphic processing and data pattern matching (ideal for streaming)
* **Storage optimized instances:**  are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage. (Suitable for data warehousing applications)

### Purchase options:
+ **On-Demand:** Ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted. No upfront cost or minimum contract applies.
+ **Savings plans:** Reduce your compute costs by committing to a consistent amount of compute usage for a 1- or 3-year term. This term commitment results in savings of up to 72% over ON-Demand costs
+ **Reserved instances:** are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions.
+ **Spot instances:** workloads that can be interrupted
+ **Dedicated host:** are physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that are fully dedicated to your use.

### Scalability and Elasticity:
**Scalability** involves beginning with only the resources you need and designing your architecture to automatically respond to changing demand by scaling out or in. 
* **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling:** This is a service provided for Amazon EC2 instances that allows the scaling process to happen automatically. Auto-scaling enables you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to changing application demand.
  * **Dynamic scaling** responds to changing demand.
  * **Predictive scaling** automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.
  * When configuring the size of an auto scaling group, you can set ***minimum capacity***, ***Desired capacity*** and ***Maximum capacity***

### Elastic Load Balancing:
Is the AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances. For example, if you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances, elastic load balancing distributes the workload across the multiple instances so that no single instance has to carry the bulk of it. 
Properly distribute traffic; high performance, cost-efficient, highly available, automatically scalable

### Messaging and queuing
* **Monolitic application** Tughtly coupled components. Applications are made of multiple components. The components communicate with each other to transmit data, fulfill requests, and keep the application running.
* **Microservices** Loosly coupled 

When designing applications on AWS, you can take a microservices approach with services and components that fulfill different functions. Two services facilitate application integration: Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).

* **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)** is a message queuing service you can send, store and receive messages between software components at any volume
  * **Payload** Data contain within a message.
* **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**  is a publish/subscribe service. Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers.

 AWS Lambda is one serverless compute option. Lambda's a service that allows you to upload your code into what's called a Lambda function. Configure a trigger and from there, the service waits for the trigger. When the trigger is detected, the code is automatically run in a managed environment, an environment you do not need to worry too much about because it is automatically scalable, highly available and all of the maintenance in the environment itself is done by AWS.
 
* **Serverless** You cannot see or access the underlying infrastructure that are hosting your application, means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers

> üí° If you are looking to run Docker container-based workloads on AWS ( A ***container*** is standard way of package your code), you first need to choose your orchestration tool either **ECS** or **EKS**. Then you need to chose your platform. Do you want to run your containers on EC2 instances that you manage or in a serverless environment like AWS Fargate that is managed for you?
