🚀 Operating system: you can choose eaither Windows or Linux </br>
🚀 Aplication(s) server: Software running on the instance Internal buisiness apps, web apps, Data bases, thir-part applications...</br>
🚀 Instance type</br>
* Vertical Scaling: EC2 instances are also resizable. You might start with a small instance, realize the application you are running is starting to max out that server, and then you can give that instance more memory and more CPU.</br>
🚀Control over the Networking: Type of requests</br>
